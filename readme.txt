Simple shortcodes to style game developer quotes as they are on the developers site.

== Description ==

Easily style posts from game companies in a way that resembles their forum posts using shortcodes. For example: Blizzards 'blue posts'. The Shortcodes are listed below. If you would like to see a style added please don’t hesitate to contact me and I’ll try to add them in the next releases.

The icon in the tinyMCE editor is a pair of green quotes("").

Syntax for shortcodes are: '[bluepost name="name"] content [/bluepost]’.

= Shortcodes Available =
* ‘bluepost’ - Blizzard style quotes
* ’torpost’ - Star Wars: The Old Republic style quotes
* ‘ps2post’ - SOE Planetside 2 style quotes
* ‘valvepost’ - Valve employee style quotes

== Installation ==
1. Upload the "Game Dev Quotes" folder to the "/wp-content/plugins" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
3. Use the provided shortcodes for output in your pags/posts/articles. '[bluepost name="name"] content [/bluepost]' or '[torpost name="name"] content [/torpost]'. Or just click on the button in tinyMCE and enter the information to add a quote.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use the shortcodes =

'[bluepost name="somename"] content [/bluepost]' Replace "bluepost" with the short code of the style you are using. "name" is the name of the game dev who posted. "content" is the actual post.
